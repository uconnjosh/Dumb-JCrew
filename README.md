## Dumb J.Crews, a parody app :) Made during our 7th week at Epicodus.
####To access the administration area (creat, update, and delete products) you need to start the rails console and create a new user with: email, password, and password confirmation.
Then, go to /sessions/new in the browser to log on. This prompts the admin panel to appear at the bottom of the webpage.
#####The cart will refresh if the user navigates to any product page, and if it has been more than an hour since the user navigated to the web site.

Epicodus Assignment:
Store
Let's make a website for a store.

As a store owner, I want to create a new entry for a product with a name, price, and description.
As a shopper, I want to see a list of all the products in the store, and be able to click on them to get more information.
As a store owner, I want to make sure only I and other store employees can add, edit, and remove products. Hint: Add user authentication. Instead of letting people sign up for the site, "seed" the site with one login you create from the Rails console. Allow that user to CRUD/L additional users. Only allow unauthenticated users to list and show products; all other actions for products and all actions for users should be restricted to authenticated users.
